# Running Vite App

This guide will walk you through the steps required to run a Vite app.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (version 12 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

## Running the App

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the Vite app by executing the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This command will start a development server and open your default web browser to display the app.

## Building for Production

To build the app for production, run:

```
npm run build
```

This command will create a production-ready build of your app in the `dist` directory.

## Additional Commands

- `npm run serve`: Serve the built app for local testing.
- `npm run lint`: Run linting checks.
- `npm run test`: Run tests.

## Customize Configuration

If you need to customize the Vite configuration, you can do so by modifying `vite.config.js`. Refer to the Vite documentation for more details on configuration options.

## Issues

If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to open an issue in the repository or reach out to the project maintainers.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
